In the area of renewable energy, solar energy is at the forefront, because producing energy by using the power of the sun is the easiest and commercially viable way of renewable energy. Speaking of solar panels, the output power of a solar panel output needs to be monitored in order to get optimum power output from the panels. This is why a real-time monitoring system becomes necessary. In a large solar power plant, it can also be used to monitor the power output from each panel which helps to identify the dust buildup.
